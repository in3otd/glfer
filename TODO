Please tell me <in3otd@qsl.net> if you feel like volunteering for any
of these ideas. 

Features or problems that need some work:
----------------------------------------
	handle MP3 format
	record input to a file
	There was some report of problems in the audio acquisition
	  routine, it seems that some audio card/driver don't work
	  well with select; this need further investigation
	Spectrogram "normal" scrolling (all the picture, right to left)
	Jason decoder (in progress)
	JPEG quality should be selectable before saving
        Palette editor and loader
	XPM icon for glfer
	...many other things...


Code cleanups and optimizations:
-------------------------------

	Check DFCW code
	File not beginning with "g_" should not need to include gtk/gtk.h
	Pay attention to WMCLASS (gtk_window_set_wmclass) (important ?)



Local Variables:
mode:indented-text
